# ALX Project Nexus 📚

## Overview
This repository documents my journey and learnings from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program.  
It also includes the planning and documentation for my final project:  
A Web + Mobile App that allows users to upload PDF books, chat with the content, and generate podcasts for book groups.
