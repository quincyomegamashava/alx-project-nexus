# Project Nexus - E-commerce Platform

A full-stack e-commerce platform with web and mobile applications, featuring complete checkout flows with multiple payment options.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Option 1: Start All Services
```bash
./start-all.sh
```

### Option 2: Start Services Individually

#### Backend API
```bash
cd api
npm start
# Runs on http://localhost:4000
```

#### Frontend Web App
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

#### Mobile App
```bash
cd mobile
npm start
# Runs on http://localhost:8081 (offline mode)
```

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### Mobile App Fetch Errors
If you see `TypeError: fetch failed` when starting the mobile app:

**Solution**: The mobile app now starts in offline mode by default to avoid connectivity issues.
- Use `npm start` for offline mode (recommended for development)
- Use `npm run start-online` if you need online mode

### Frontend Images Not Loading
If product images show as placeholders:

**Fixed**: Product images have been copied to the frontend public directory and the image utility has been updated to handle local images in development mode.

**Manual Fix** (if needed):
```bash
cp api/public/images/*.jpeg frontend/public/images/
```

### Backend API Connection Issues
Make sure the backend is running before starting the frontend/mobile apps:

```bash
cd api
npm start
```

The API should show:
```
ðŸš€ Server running on http://localhost:4000
ðŸ“Š Database initialized
```
